# Studies for a future Web after HTML & CSS

## Focus

These studies are focused on an alternative to the HTML + CSS. Also, the JS integration, I mean the DOM, the JS part that integrates with HTML and CSS.

The objective of the investigation here is not to generate any new library or product but, rather, establish a concept to possibly guide future projects.

The idea came after these two articles:
- https://msandrini.medium.com/all-the-issues-with-html-the-frontend-land-where-time-stood-still-7c7109aec581
- https://msandrini.medium.com/css-the-wrong-choice-the-web-has-taken-b0cfc1b81a57

## Main goals

- Update HTML to 2021, shifting focus from separation of concerns and, therefore, semantics to simple content-oriented structure;
- Change styles from a selector-oriented model (cascading) to a model that better fits the programmers' mindset;
